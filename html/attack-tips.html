        <div class="second-level-div">
            <h3>Did I Hit?</h3>
            <p><strong>Roll a d20:</strong> To determine if you hit the target, roll a d20 and add your attack modifier (based on Strength or Dexterity, depending on the weapon). If you're proficient with the weapon, add your proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p><strong>Compare the Result to the Target's Armor Class (AC):</strong> If your roll meets or exceeds the AC, you hit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-level-div">
            <h3>How Much Damage?</h3>
            <p>If you hit, roll the weapon's damage dice and add any relevant modifiers. For example, if your weapon deals 1d6 damage and your Dexterity modifier is +5, you add +5 to the roll.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-level-div">
            <h3>Sneak Attack</h3>
            <p>If you have advantage on the attack or an ally is within 5 feet of the target, you can apply your Sneak Attack damage (3d6 at Level 6). This is added to the regular weapon damage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-level-div">
            <h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3>
            <p>If you are hit by an attack that you can see, you can use your reaction to halve the damage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-level-div">
            <h3>Crits</h3>
            <p>If you roll a natural 20 on the attack roll, you score a critical hit. When you score a critical hit, roll the damage dice twice and then add any modifiers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-level-div">
            <h3>Two-Weapon Fighting</h3>
            <p>If you're wielding two light weapons, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with your off-hand weapon. You donâ€™t add your modifier to the off-hand weapon damage, except for your Dexterity modifier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-level-div">
            <h3>Opportunity Attacks</h3>
            <p>When a hostile creature you can see moves out of your reach, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-level-div">
            <h3> Ranged Attacks</h3>
            <p>When making a ranged attack, make sure you're within the weapon's range (normal or long range) and that there is nothing obstructing your line of sight.</p>
