                <p>Fen Underbough was born in the twisting backstreets of Fendeya, the Black City. A natural fit for its shadowy corners and winding alleys, he grew up among rogues and smugglers, learning to navigate the dangerous web of Fendeya’s criminal underworld. His family, simple merchants eking out a living, tried to shield him from that life, but freedom always called to him louder than caution.</p>

                <p>Fen’s trust issues took root when his family became entangled with a group called the Forbidden Eye. They had agreed to smuggle a relic—a seemingly innocuous golden orb—to the alliance, unaware of its true value. However, a betrayal by a trusted family friend led to the exposure of their operation. Fen’s parents were taken by the Forbidden Eye for interrogation, leaving him alone and desperate. The orb itself vanished in the chaos, spirited away to the higher-ups in the organization, but its loss left scars on Fen’s soul.</p>
                
                <p>Now, Fen’s every move is driven by a single goal: to recover that orb, the last remaining link to his parents and their freedom. He believes that its power—or the secrets it contains—might be enough to leverage their release or uncover the truth of their fate.</p>
                    
                <p>Over the years, Fen honed his skills as a thief and infiltrator, slipping through cracks in society as easily as a shadow on the wall. He grew wary of trusting anyone, learning the hard way that betrayal often comes from those closest to you. However, this hasn’t dulled his charm or wit. If anything, Fen hides his distrust behind a mask of wry humor and a silver tongue, making others underestimate his sharp instincts.</p>
                    
                <p>Despite his bitterness, Fen is guided by an unshakable belief: chains are meant to be broken. Whether it’s freeing prisoners from dungeons, unraveling conspiracies, or breaking down societal structures, Fen feels compelled to shatter the bonds that hold others captive. This drive is also the source of his greatest weakness: his inability to resist something valuable. The thrill of the steal and the idea of turning someone else’s hoarded wealth into freedom fuel his every heist.</p>
                    
                <p>Though he avoids alliances, Fen’s growing reputation as a rogue with a purpose has drawn the attention of factions like the Cult of Vanags and House Greathollow, who might see him as either a threat or a potential tool. The question remains whether Fen can hold onto his freedom—or his morality—while playing the high-stakes game of Nolemt’s growing conflicts.</p>
